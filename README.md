# odin_rock_paper_scissors

This is my first project after learning some of the basics of Javascript. Initially, the rock paper scissors game was simulated entirely
within the console. The game consisted of 5 rounds in which a winner is announced at the end.

After learning DOM manipulation and basics of events, I updated the project to have a basic UI the user could interact with via buttons. The results of each round would be shown on text on the webpage.
